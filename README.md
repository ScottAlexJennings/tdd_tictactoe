Sharing is caring! This is part of a learning journey. We are much more curious individuals than experts. The objective is to share our learnings so far while enabling us to collaborate, learn and connect around an important topic. We assume that independently of your experience, you are curious to learn, courageous to ask and share and, finally, respectful about the stage each one is in right now.

The workshop is based on our own work together.
You will find imperfections or questionable things, let's discuss them.

Commit early and often!
Good practices for a commit, by [Chris Beams](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

# Purpose
Dive into tests and Test-Driven-Development (TDD) by sharing experience and practicing together
- Practical workshop, mainly with examples
- Think programming as communicating 
  * Simple, clear, robust code
  * Maintainable, scalable, understandable
  * Effective, resilient to change

# Why tests?
- Make sure the code works as expected
- Detect edge cases
- Feel confident to refactor without being afraid of breaking the entire pipeline
- Your teammates can understand your functions by looking at your tests
- Prevent unexpected output
- Simplifies updating code
- Increases overall efficiency of developing code
- And most importantly prevents you from pushing any broken code into production!

- Consider starting by forking the repository so you donot push things to main.
- If you cannot fork it, just make your own branch or just develop locally. 
- Use the main branch for starting up, if you think this is too much work you can also look at the complete 
- There is already a failing test available for you, try to fix it and then decide if you need to refactor. 
- Think about the next functionality you should write the test for, it will fail in the begining and that is the point so no worries there and then write code to fix it =) 
- and of course HAVE FUN !
